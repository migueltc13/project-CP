# Program Design by Calculation Project

This repository contains a collection of exercises implemented in Haskell
within the *Program Design by Calculation* environment in the 2024/2025 academic year.

This project follows a **literate programming** approach, where the source code and
documentation are intertwined in a single file.

For detailed implementations and documentation, please refer to:
- [cp2425.lhs](cp2425.lhs) (literate Haskell source)
- [cp2425.pdf](cp2425.pdf) (compiled documentation)
